 Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 
 
 Iâ€™m Chris, currently in the process of learning front-end development. I recently graduated from a postgraduate JavaScript Developer course at Bialystok University of Technology, acquiring a solid foundation in JavaScript and experience with popular frontend frameworks like React and Angular. Additionally, I deepened my knowledge of the backend, focusing on Node.js.

  My second great passion is fitness and bodybuilding. When I'm not sitting in front of a computer, you'll definitely find me at the gym, where I also realize myself professionally. I hope to build a career in both fields.

  Check out my portfolio and projects below. ðŸ‘€
